    <p>
        I am an LLB graduate from the University of the Free State, currently based in Gauteng.
        My professional journey is driven by a passion for growth and a strong work ethic, 
        which I have developed through academic studies and volunteer work. 
        In my roles as a Student Advisor and Student Consultant at the UFS Law Clinic,
        I gained practical experience in client communication, legal research and writing,
        and courtroom advocacy. Working with low-income clients on various legal issues provided me with valuable hands-on experience. 
        Additionally, my involvement as a Student Volunteer at Engo Child & Youth Care allowed me to enhance my analytical and interpersonal skills. 
        Providing support and guidance to children and youth in need was a rewarding experience that reinforced my ability to work both independently and collaboratively within a team.
         Overall, these experiences have equipped me with a diverse skill set, and I am confident in my capacity to make a positive contribution to any legal organisation.
